        When you release a spell you've prepared, roll+INT. • On a 10+ the the
        spell is successfully cast and you may cast the spell again later. • On
        a 7-9 the spell is cast, but choose one:
      </div>
      <ul class="ml-5 text-sm list-disc">
        <li>
          You draw unwelcome attention or put yourself in a spot. The GM will
          tell you how.
        </li>
        <li>
          The spell disturbs the fabric of reality as it is cast; take -1
          ongoing to cast a spell until the next time you Prepare Spells.
        </li>
        <li>
          After it is cast, the spell is forgotten. You cannot cast the spell
          again until you prepare spells.

        Note that maintaining spells with ongoing effects will sometimes cause a
        penalty to your roll to cast a spell.

        You have mastered several spells and inscribed them in your spellbook.
        You start out with three first level spells, as well as all your
        cantrips. Whenever you gain a level, you inscribe a new spell of your
        level or lower. Your spellbook is 1 weight.

        You may end any ongoing spell immediately and use the energy of its
        dissipation to deflect an oncoming attack. The spell ends and you
        subtract its level from the damage done to you.
