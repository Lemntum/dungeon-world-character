          You learned your magic in a place whose spirits are strong and ancient
          and they've marked you as one of their own. No matter where you go,
          they live within you and allow you to take their shape. Choose one of
          the following. It is the land to which you are attuned—when
          shapeshifting you may take the shape of any animal who might live in
          your Land.

        Chose a tell—a physical attribute that marks you as born of the
        soil—that reflects the spirit of your land. It may be an animal feature
        like antlers or leopard's spots or something more general: hair like
        leaves or eyes of glittering crystal. Your tell remains no matter what
        shape you take.

        When you call upon the spirits to change your shape, roll+Wis. • On a
        10+ hold 3. • On a 7-9 hold 2. • On a miss hold 1 in addition to
        whatever the GM says. You may take on the physical form of any species
        whose essence you have studied or who lives in your land: you and your
        possessions meld into a perfect copy of the species' form. You have any
        innate abilities and weaknesses of the form: claws, wings, gills,
        breathing water instead of air. You still use your normal stats but some
        moves may be harder to trigger—a housecat will find it hard to do battle
        with an ogre. The GM will also tell you one or more moves associated
        with your new form. Spend 1 hold to make that move. Once you're out of
        hold, you return to your natural form. At any time, you may spend all
        your hold and revert to your natural form.

        vision is unclear, its meaning murky. • On a miss, the vision is
        upsetting, frightening, or traumatizing. The GM will describe it. Take
